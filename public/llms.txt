# Connai

> AI-powered Digital Maturity Assessment platform. Connai runs structured, conversational AI interviews with business stakeholders and generates a scored report across 8 dimensions of digital maturity.

## What Connai does

Connai guides organisations through a Digital Maturity Assessment via an AI interviewer that uses HUMINT-style elicitation techniques. After one or more stakeholder interviews, it produces a scored report (0–100 per dimension), an AI-generated action plan, and a shareable report page.
